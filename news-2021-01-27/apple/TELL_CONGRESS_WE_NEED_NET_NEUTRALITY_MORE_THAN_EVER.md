TELL CONGRESS: WE NEED NET NEUTRALITY MORE THAN EVER
====================================================

Ajit Pai is
lying
again, boasting that his efforts to destroy net neutrality have encouraged ISPs to invest in
broadband. In reality, big cable companies like
AT&T and
Comcast
have slashed billions of dollars from programs that would provide high-speed Internet access
to everyone in America. Now more than ever, we are in
desperate need of broadband
to ensure that we all have access to education, communication, and economic opportunities.
Tell Congress: Restore net neutrality and protect our digital rights!

Fight for net neutrality
------------------------

Ever since the FCC repealed net neutrality, ISPs like Verizon, AT&T and
T-Mobile have been

throttling traffic "pretty much everywhere all the time." Worse yet,
federal courts have

refused to overturn the FCC's disastrous decision, leaving us with few
options to restore freedom online.


Our last hope? Win net neutrality at the state level. This will show the
federal government that the

majority of Americans demand a free and open Internet, pressuring our
lawmakers to enshrine net neutrality into national law once and for all.
We've already won in

California, and we're going to win in other states, too. But we need your
support, now more than ever.


Hereâs how you can help:

Save the Internet Act of 2019

------------------------------

In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted the

Open Internet Order
to protect Internet users from ISPs throttling traffic, censoring content,
and imposing unfair fees. But just a few years later, a new chairman of the FCC

killed net neutrality
by repealing the Open Internet order. It's clear that we can't count on unelected
bureaucrats to consistently defend our online freedoms, and we can't rely on the
courts to overrule disastrous policy decisions, either. We need strong legislation
to protect net neutrality for as long as the Internet exists.


The Save the Internet Act of 2019
is a simple, three-page bill that would restore the Open Internet Order
enshrining net neutrality into law. Plain and simple. Read it for yourself below,
then contact your Congressional lawmakers to urge them to support this important
legislation:

### S. 682 - The Save the Internet Act

### A BILL

Communications Commission.



Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

(c) PROHIBITION ON REISSUED RULE OR NEW RULE.âThe Commission may not
reissue the Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order described in
subsection (b) in substantially the same form, or issue a new rule that
is substantially the same as that Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order,

We're making Congress listen

-----------------------------

Voters from across the political spectrum agree: they don't want their
cable company to control what they see and do online. The FCC's reckless
repeal of net neutrality has sparked an unprecedented backlash, as
millions of Americans have contacted their lawmakers in protest. The
numbers below represent actions taken through BattleForTheNet.com and its
partners. Many more have taken action on other sites or contacted their
lawmakers directly.

To help convince the House, contact congress
now and add to these numbers.

What is net neutrality? Why does it matter?
-------------------------------------------

Net neutrality is the principle that everyone should have access to
websites and apps, preventing Internet providers like Comcast & Verizon
from creating âfast lanes,â censoring
content,
throttling traffic and even outright blocking access to their competitor's products. This
principle has guided the world wide web from the beginning, and has been
protected by federal policy under Republican AND Democrat leadership since
the early 2000s.

Unfortunately, Internet providers ignored this policy and even actively
sued the federal government to destroy net neutrality
protections â¦ and they won. Their anti-consumer practices finally convinced
the FCC to issue the Open Internet Order as a last resort in 2015. But
under new leadership, the FCC has removed these regulations, threatening
to end the web as we know it. A federal court ruling has opened up a path
for net neutrality laws at the state and national level, giving open Internet
supporters hope that the Save the Internet Act can enshrine net neutrality
into law once and for all.

We are Team Internet
--------------------

Members of Team Internet support free speech and free markets online through
meaningful, enforceable net neutrality laws. We are everyday Americans from
across the political spectrum. We are
thousands
of small business owners. We are startups, tech giants and grassroots
organizations with millions of members. Check out the list below to see whoâs
taken action to save net neutrality:

They are Team Cable
-------------------

Team Cable wants to end net neutrality so they can control and tax the
Internet. Team Cable lies about the effects of net neutrality on the free
market and ignores blatant corruption in the regulatory process.
If they get their way, we will all pay more money for worse Internet
access. Independent voices will be stifled. And innovative start-ups will
struggle to compete in the online marketplace.
