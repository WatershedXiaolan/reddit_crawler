Phone Calls Will Finally Stop Taking Up the Entire Screen in iOS 14
===================================================================

Apple today announced a small but long-awaited change being made in iOS 14 and iPadOS 14: incoming phone and FaceTime calls will no longer take up the entire screen, providing for a much less disruptive experience. 

iOS 14 is available in beta for registered Apple developers today, with a public beta to follow next month. The software update will be released to all users with an iPhone 6s or newer in the fall.

One thing I'm wondering is that with this being a notification at the top is whether or not this will be as easy to use especially one handed and especially on larger phones.

Kinda wish it was at the bottom of the screen though. Easier to reach.
