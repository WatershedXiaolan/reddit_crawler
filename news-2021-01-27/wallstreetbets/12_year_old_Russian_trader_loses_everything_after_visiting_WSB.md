"Sasha who gave you the money?" "Your employer" lol i died.

That’s a weird way to say me

Why do I see five digit losses when you never had more than $100?

In the motherland stocks buy you.

Narrator: "Little Sasha will become one of the millions posting loss port at WSB, because what he fails to understand is that - STONKS ONLY GO UP"

Fucking died. If I had any money I would gild this post

I lost it at wsb is my real mom

This comment literally made me spit up coffee lol

Is that from something up or did OP actually make that up? Because that fucking killed me too and I can't imagine it's the first time someone thought it up.

Oh my fucking god the 1:18 mark.

“What’s AAPL?”

“A stonk.”

Holy shit that paired up perfectly with the audio. This is a high quality shitpost. Can’t stop laughing at this retarded shit.

Now that I noticed it tho I feel like every word in Russian just kinda sounds like stonk with some tongue rolling in between

It synced up too perfectly. As if that's what they were actually talking about. I died
