Happy Holidays! Made a user-directed greeting card using Python Turtle Graphics
===============================================================================

Upvoted for the breaking window animation üòÇ

I love literally everything about this video man, brings back memories from literally weeks ago coding in stuff like this.

What a fantastic touch

I thought it was snow at first, but then I wondered how an ice pick can just splat like snow. This makes more sense.

So much this

‚ÄúDo you want the sky to be black or sky blue?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt realize black sky meant night and thought this program was going to be metal.

Enter Santaman

The cybertruck is metal.

Black sky, red snow, cybertruck on fire.

The sky over the harbor was the color of television tuned to a dead channel.

That line is very different depending on when you grew up.

Excellent work. This is the kind of content I need to see as a python newbie. Now, about that code...

yes, i want simple projects to attempt like this one

Very cool and creative idea! Do you have the code somewhere up?

You really missed the opportunity to say ‚ÄúDo you want to build a snowman?‚Äù

Let it go

Come on let's go out and play

Hell's Pass Hospital!

Yes! I see it now lol

Curious about the text - is that also Turtle? Or other?

Yes

I love it and all, but why wouldn't you put that space at the end of input()?
