So I made a Python and Arduino project that dynamically changes sets the ambient lighting to match the computed dominant color values from the wallpapers.
==========================================================================================================================================================

This is really cool. I also love all of your wallpapers. Would making this work for something like every X frame of a video game work? Or would that fry the Arduino. I‚Äôm not very familiar with them.

Thanks a lot! Yes. That was definitely in my mind. Wouldn't be a bad idea to attempt. CPU optimisation would be key there.

You could just use the Raspi TV ambient lighting setup like this:

Look up Prismatik, Ambibox, Hyperion projects

You're describing a project called Adalight. I built one a few years back - it works really well!

60 frames a second or worst, if it's a 144hz monitor, 144 frames a second. Getting that amount of data would very likely be too much for an Arduino.

Now, whether you could minimize that, by not getting it every frame, and instead only a few times a second, without your eyes noticing it, that'd be the real interesting part.

If the data is being captured by using a screen grab, another hard part to take into account is screen resolution. At 4k+, even shrunk down to a workable size, is still processing power used to shrink a 4k screen grab down to a manageable "color checking" size.

It's cool, but moving from stills into the realm of movies and video games seems very cumbersome or at least a large increase in code, and checking that things are working smoothly enough for the eye not to see a flicker, which could end up being more annoying than cool.

can you please share these wallpapers :) great work btw

Hey guys! Thank you all for your overwhelming responses. This is my first time ever posting on Reddit. Didn't expect such great responses. Thanks a lot. Definitely motivates me to keep going. Also for everyone asking for code, I will be making the repo ready for public by the end of the day so for those willing to contribute can start right away. Thanks again guys. Means a lot to meüôåüèª

awesome! , looking forward to contribute

Great work!! üòÉ Do you have plans to share your code? Very interested in this ;)

Can you show in what order did you put leds on the back of the monitor?

Code?

It's a rather simple code.

All my wallpapers are from these 2 sources

Awesome!

Are you going to upload this on github? I want to know how it works.

Will soon!

That's neat! Can you please share some guides if you have?
