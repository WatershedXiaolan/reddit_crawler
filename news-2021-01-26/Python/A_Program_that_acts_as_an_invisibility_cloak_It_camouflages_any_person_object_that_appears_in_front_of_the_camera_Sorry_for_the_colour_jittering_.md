A Program that acts as an "invisibility cloak"... It camouflages any person/object that appears in front of the camera.... Sorry for the colour jitteringðŸ™ˆ

What are the odds that I see two people doing the exact same project on the same day!

Nonetheless, good job OP!

Oh, it's a little common project

Yup. That!

So a green screen?

Yep, a green screen.

Probably to a degree but not in the same way. Green screens work by having two image or video feeds, mapping one onto the other. This project doing that in real time is more interesting since it is only using one video feed

But diy program

Except its taking the last photo of the pixels behind the green screen and placing it. At least that what looks to be happening.

Just saw a similar project in LinkedIn as well it's quite interesting

Ya there was a lady (wearing black dress) who did the same thing... I saw that video and got inspired to make similar kind of program for me.. Like I found it very interesting

Linkedin is filled with this exact project for past 4-5 months (kind of irritating) ... At the end it's all about learning experience so no harm on that :)

Idk if i should be sharing it here or in r/learnpython... For those who are looking for resources : i followed few youtube tutorials but incase you just need code with minimal explanation you can follow THIS Article (not my article).

It's too long for me to type and explain everything plus i m really tired (after coming from my workplace)

Note: Since I used white cloth i had to manipulate only saturation values (range 0 to 30) The reason why there are 2 lower and upper ranges of hsv is bcz red occurs at 2 places in hsv chart (sorry it's difficult for me to explain like this, but you can find tons if resources on net) P. S. Sharing is caring. Thank you for the up votes

Repo?

It's not there on github. But i have posted resources in comments section

Chroma-key or "green screen"

Mission impossible 4 is real

All that's left is a remote sounding water dripper gadget to distract the guard.
