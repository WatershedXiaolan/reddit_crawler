Just trying to create a orbit system in python and this happened...
===================================================================

When my code messes up I get error messages meanwhile you‚Äôre over here making art

I went through plenty of errors to get to that stage. But the best bit is that it was a complete accident that this happened.

‚ÄúHelp my program is broken!‚Äù .... ‚Äúok what was the return code lets start from there‚Äù ...  ‚Äúa spirograph‚Äù ... ‚Äúoooook‚Äù

This made me laugh üòÜ

I don‚Äôt even get errors, I just notice that all the numbers I‚Äôve been reporting for months are off by an order of magnitude.

Have you ever heard about screen capture programs ? ;)

did you just solve the 3 body problem?

The Trisolarans will be ecstatic!

I highly doubt it. It's more like a simulation of the 3 body problem.

REHYDRATE!!!

The 3 body problem has several known solutions for initial start states. The problem is that there's no know way to calculate ALL future states for ALL initial start states. Simulating a particular case is easy enough, but that's not the same as solving the problem.

In the book, they use the human computer thing as a simulation to find what happens next, over the next X years or whatever. Obviously they get it wrong, but that's not the point here. The point is if they had computers then they'd easily be able to calculate future states for their system, since the start state is known. Finally that simulation would grow more and more inaccurate as time progresses, due to the fact that even a 3 body simulation is a prediction (it doesn't take into account other masses, such as asteroids / moons / other planets / etc...), and it's based on a measured start state, and that measurement will have an error.
