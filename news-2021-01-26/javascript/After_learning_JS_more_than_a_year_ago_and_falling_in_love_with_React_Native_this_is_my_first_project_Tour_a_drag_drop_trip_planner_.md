After learning JS more than a year ago and falling in love with React Native, this is my first project, Tour, a drag-drop trip planner.
=======================================================================================================================================

This is your first project, after having used JavaScript for only one year?

That’s nothing short of amazing, OP!

Yes it is, tbqh I have done a couple other misc things like my own website and a half-finished React Native app, but none was as big of an undertaking like this one.

thought it looks rather too good for OP not have a background in UI design? still impressive anyway.

iOS Beta: tourapp.co/beta

The beta is only available on iOS for now. I’m looking to work on and find people to help with creating an Android version along with a webapp soon after.



Why?

This came out of my own annoyance of planning trips, I book a flight, hotel, and then find things to do, but where do I put it all together? A google doc? notes? calendar? I looked to the app store and I felt that a lot of the popular trip planning apps had horrible UI/UX. Tripit, Sygic Travel, Google Trips, etc the lot. So I came up with this drag-drop interface with the goal of eliminating the annoying manual entry of activities that plagued Tripit.

After having learned JavaScript in the latter half of 2017, and had tinkered around with React/React Native a couple times before, and thought this would be a great project to give it a test run. Anyways, do give the beta a try, and any feedback is greatly appreciated! This is my first React Native app and I’m eager to improve. It’s a startup that I’m doing with /u/2001kraft.



How?

Most if not all the components are hand-coded from scratch because I wanted to retain full control on crafting the UX. At the moment I’m currently hard at work adding Booking.com integration and hotels/accommodation to your trip.

Stack:

Backend: Firebase.

Db: Firebase Firestore.

Store: Redux.

Maps: Mapbox.

Navigation: React-Navigation.

Updates: Codepush.

Styling: Styled-Components.



Damn!

A couple days ago I posted this on both r/reactjs and r/reactnative and it became top post of all time on both of them. I absolutely adored the feedback and critiques. Looking forward to what r/javascript will say. I'm also looking to open source some of the code very soon once release is done.



You can keep up with Tour on r/officialtourapp.

I'll also be sharing resources and components there soon.

Such an amazing job dude! How have you done the calendar, just with react and styled-components? Looks so clean.

Are you planning an android version? If so, where can I sign up for updates?

We're also on ProductHunt (all our other social media is there)!

Thanks for this, I’m looking for more react native apps to see if it’s worth learning it (I’m a native iOS dev).

If I'm not mistaken RN allows you to do both ios and Android app, why not release also the android version?

Seems amazing though!

Did you document some kind of your journey in a blog or something? E.g. the maps features (routing etc.) is interesting..

How big is your node modules?

Great job on this.. Kudos to your work. Fyi, I am learning JS as well.

What's the reason for not having an android app? Edit: nvm, read that you're working on it

U have trouble with your website in landing)

I'm assuming that you're hitting multiple APIs for all of this information?

Sygic Travel for Destinations, Foursquare for activities, Mapbox for maps, and soon Booking.com for integrated hotel booking and Amadeus for flights.
