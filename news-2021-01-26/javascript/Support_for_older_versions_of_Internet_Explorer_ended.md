What does this mean?
--------------------

It’s time to act. Since 1/12/16, Microsoft no longer provides security updates or technical support for old versions of Internet Explorer. Regular security updates help protect devices so upgrading and staying current is important.

Without critical browser security updates, your PC may become vulnerable to harmful viruses, spyware, and other malicious software which can steal or damage your business data and information.

#### Compliance risk

Businesses that are governed by regulatory obligations such as HIPAA should conduct due diligence to assess whether they are still able to satisfy compliance requirements using unsupported software.

Many Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) no longer support older versions of Internet Explorer. For example, Microsoft 365 takes advantage of modern web standards and runs best with the latest browser, Microsoft Edge.
